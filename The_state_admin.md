## The State Administrator: Powers and Jurisdiction 

The sources provide information about the powers and jurisdiction of a state administrator in relation to securities law, particularly the Uniform Securities Act. 

### Jurisdiction

The state administrator, often the attorney general or a designated team, has jurisdiction over securities transactions that originate in, are directed to, or are accepted in their state. This jurisdiction applies even if the individual accepting the offer is not a resident of that state.  

**Offers and Sales:** 

- The administrator's jurisdiction covers both offers and sales of securities.
    - An **offer** is an attempt to solicit a purchase of a security in exchange for something of value. This could be through various means like a phone call, email, text message, or even a newspaper advertisement.
    - A **sale** occurs when an offer is accepted, resulting in a securities transaction. 
- **Exemptions:**
    - Some transactions are **exempt** from the administrator's jurisdiction. 
        - For instance, gifts of non-accessible securities are not considered offers or sales. A **non-accessible security** is a security where the issuing corporation cannot demand additional capital from the shareholder. Conversely, a gift of an **accessible security** would fall under the administrator's jurisdiction.
        - Other exemptions include:
           - Stock dividends, stock splits, and cash dividends.
           - Bona fide pledges of securities as collateral for a loan.
           - Transactions resulting from approved mergers or business reorganizations.

**Geographic Reach:**

- The administrator's jurisdiction extends to their state and any transaction that "touches" it. For example, if an offer originates in State A, is directed to State B, and accepted in State C, the administrators of all three states would have jurisdiction. 
- However, the requirement to register in each state with jurisdiction depends on factors like residency and the nature of the transaction.

**Enforcement:**

- The state administrator has the power to investigate and take action against individuals or firms suspected of violating securities laws within their jurisdiction.
- They can issue subpoenas to compel individuals to provide testimony or submit documents for examination.
- They have the authority to inspect firms without prior notice. 

### Powers

**Registration:**

- The administrator oversees the registration of securities professionals (like agents, broker-dealers, and investment advisors) and securities offerings within their state.
- They have the power to deny, suspend, or revoke registrations for various reasons. 
    - **Denial:** Grounds for denial include misleading or incomplete applications, failure to pay fees, suspension in another state, violation of securities laws, statutory disqualification (typically due to felonies, securities-related misdemeanors, or ethical violations), and insolvency. 
    - **Revocation:** Insolvency is a strong basis for revoking a broker-dealer or investment advisor's registration. 
    - **Lack of Experience:** While lack of experience cannot be the sole reason to deny an individual's registration, it can be a factor in denying a firm's registration if it lacks experienced personnel.

**Enforcement Actions:**

- The administrator can issue **cease and desist orders** to stop individuals or firms from engaging in potentially illegal activities. While these orders lack immediate legal repercussions, ignoring them can lead to court-ordered injunctions, potentially resulting in contempt of court charges. 
- They can apply for court injunctions to legally compel individuals or firms to cease unlawful activities.
- They can refer criminal violations to the appropriate legal authorities for prosecution. 

**Other Powers:**

- The administrator can grant exemptions or exclusions from registration requirements if the applicant meets specific criteria.
- They can cancel registrations on a non-punitive basis if a registrant is deceased, mentally incompetent, or has ceased business operations. This cancellation is not a punishment and can be appealed if the registrant resurfaces or recovers.

**Investor Protection:**

- The administrator plays a crucial role in protecting investors who have been victims of securities law violations. They can help facilitate an **offer of rescission**, where the party at fault offers to buy back the securities from the investor and compensate them for any losses.  

**Limitations:**

- While the state administrator has significant authority, there are limitations to their power. 
- They cannot impose record-keeping requirements on federally covered investment advisors or broker-dealers that are stricter than those imposed by the SEC. 
- They generally handle civil violations and refer criminal cases to the courts.
