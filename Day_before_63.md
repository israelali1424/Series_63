### Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Transactions (Series 63)

#### Exempt Transactions:
- **Definition**: Transactions that are not required to register with the state under the Uniform Securities Act.
- **Common Examples**:
  - **Isolated non-issuer transactions**: One-time trades that donâ€™t involve an issuer (e.g., private resale).
  - **Unsolicited brokerage transactions**: Transactions initiated by the client, not the broker.
  - **Institutional investor transactions**: Trades with financial institutions like banks or insurance companies.
  - **Fiduciary transactions**: Executed by executors, trustees, or guardians.
  - **Private placements**: Offers made to a limited number of investors (typically fewer than 10 within 12 months).
- **Purpose**: Reduces the regulatory burden for certain investors and transactions where full state oversight is unnecessary.

#### Non-Exempt Transactions:
- **Definition**: Transactions that must be registered with the state.
- **Examples**:
  - **Public offerings**: Offers made to the general public.
  - **Issuer transactions**: When the issuer itself is involved in the sale of securities.
  - **Solicited transactions**: Transactions initiated by brokers or agents rather than the client.

#### Key Points for Series 63:
- Exempt transactions often involve private, unsolicited, or institutional trades.
- Non-exempt transactions typically require full registration and are more public-facing.
