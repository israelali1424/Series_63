# Investment Advisor Representatives (IARs) Study Guide

## I. Definition and Roles

IARs are natural persons/individuals who work for investment advisory firms and perform the following functions:

1. Provide securities-related advice
2. Manage client portfolios or accounts
3. Determine what advice should be given (e.g., chief investment officer, research team)
4. Solicit new advisory clients
5. Supervise other investment advisor representatives

**Note**: Performing ANY ONE of these functions triggers registration as an IAR.

## II. Registration Requirements

### A. State-Level Registration

- IARs always register at the state level
- Registration requirements depend on the type of firm they work for:

#### 1. State-Registered Investment Advisory Firm
IARs must register in states where they:
- Have a place of business
- Have more than five retail clients

#### 2. Federal Covered Investment Advisory Firm
IARs must register only in states where they:
- Have a place of business

### B. Registration Process

### B. Notice Requirements

1. For IARs working with State-Registered Firms:
   - The firm gives notice to the state administrator

2. For IARs working with Federal Covered Firms:
   - The IAR must give notice themselves

**Mnemonic**: "I" in IAR looks like "1" - only one party gives notice (vs. "A" for agents where all parties give notice)

## IV. Practice Questions

### Question 1: State-Registered Firm Scenario

IAR works for a state-registered firm in states A, B, C, D, and E:
- Offices in A and B
- 1 retail client in C
- 5 retail clients in D
- 15 retail clients in E

**Answer**: IAR must register in A, B, and E (offices in A & B, more than 5 clients in E)

IAR works for a federal covered firm that notice files in states A, B, C, D, and E:
- Offices in A and B
- 1 retail client in C
- 5 retail clients in D
- 15 retail clients in E

**Answer**: IAR must register in A and B only (based on office locations)

## V. Key Points to Remember

- IARs always register at the state level
- Registration requirements differ based on the firm type (state-registered vs. federal covered)
- For state-registered firms, both office locations and client numbers matter
- For federal covered firms, only office locations matter
- Pay close attention to the firm type when determining registration requirements
