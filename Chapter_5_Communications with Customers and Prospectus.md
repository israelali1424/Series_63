# Chapter Five: Communications with Customers and Prospects

In this chapter, we delve into the communication rules for securities professionals, focusing on the necessary disclosures and the types of messages that are permitted or prohibited.

## Key Goals and Takeaways

### 1. Disclosures
- Understand the required disclosures when recruiting prospective clients and communicating with existing ones.
- Disclosures are essential in the securities industry as they enable investors to make informed decisions. 
- For the exam, know the key account fees that must be disclosed: physical certificate issuance fees, account transfer fees, and margin account interest fees.
- Not considered account fees (and thus disclosed separately): commissions, markups, markdowns, and advisory fees.

### 2. Misrepresentation
- Securities professionals must avoid misrepresentations about their roles or the securities they offer.
- Statements implying regulatory approval, endorsement, or accuracy (e.g., "approved by the New York State Administrator" or "the SEC reviewed the prospectus for accuracy") are prohibited.
- Allowed statements include factual ones about registration status (e.g., "I am a registered agent of broker-dealer ABC").

### 3. Rules on Testimonials, Endorsements, and Advertisements
- Advertisements are considered offers and can trigger state securities administrator jurisdiction.
- Offers made via TV, radio, or newspapers are treated differently when crossing state lines:
  - A TV or radio ad broadcast in one state is not considered an offer in other states, preventing jurisdiction transfer.
  - Newspaper ads published in one state are considered offers only within that state.
  - Newspapers of general circulation (two-thirds readership outside the state of publication) do not constitute offers anywhere, including in the state of publication.

### 4. Using Social Media
- Securities professionals must adhere to specific rules when using social media to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

## Examples of Allowed vs. Prohibited Communications

### Allowed Statements
- A registered agent accurately describing their status.
- Guaranteeing returns based on a third party, such as a parent company guaranteeing a subsidiary's bond payments.
- Charging higher commissions due to a trade’s risk or liquidity, provided the client is informed and agrees.

### Prohibited Statements
- Using terms like "approved" or "endorsed" when referring to registration status.
- Guaranteeing investment performance or gains.

### Case Scenarios on Jurisdiction
1. **Offer by an agent in State X to a client in State Y (no purchase made):** Jurisdiction is with both State X (origin) and State Y (directed into).
2. **TV ad broadcast in State D, received in States D, E, and F:** Jurisdiction is only in State D.
3. **Advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation based in State H, read in State G:** No jurisdiction anywhere as it’s not considered an offer.
