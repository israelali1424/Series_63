# Chapter Five: Communications with Customers and Prospects

In this chapter, we delve into the communication rules for securities professionals, focusing on the necessary disclosures and the types of messages that are permitted or prohibited.

## Key Goals and Takeaways

### 1. Disclosures
- Understand the required disclosures when recruiting prospective clients and communicating with existing ones.
- Disclosures are essential in the securities industry as they enable investors to make informed decisions. 
- For the exam, know the key account fees that must be disclosed: physical certificate issuance fees, account transfer fees, and margin account interest fees.
- Not considered account fees (and thus disclosed separately): commissions, markups, markdowns, and advisory fees.

### 2. Misrepresentation
- Securities professionals must avoid misrepresentations about their roles or the securities they offer.
- Statements implying regulatory approval, endorsement, or accuracy (e.g., "approved by the New York State Administrator" or "the SEC reviewed the prospectus for accuracy") are prohibited.
- Allowed statements include factual ones about registration status (e.g., "I am a registered agent of broker-dealer ABC").

### 3. Rules on Testimonials, Endorsements, and Advertisements
- Advertisements are considered offers and can trigger state securities administrator jurisdiction.
- Offers made via TV, radio, or newspapers are treated differently when crossing state lines:
  - A TV or radio ad broadcast in one state is not considered an offer in other states, preventing jurisdiction transfer.
  - Newspaper ads published in one state are considered offers only within that state.
  - Newspapers of general circulation (two-thirds readership outside the state of publication) do not constitute offers anywhere, including in the state of publication.

### 4. Using Social Media
- Securities professionals must adhere to specific rules when using social media to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

## Examples of Allowed vs. Prohibited Communications

### Allowed Statements
- A registered agent accurately describing their status.
- Guaranteeing returns based on a third party, such as a parent company guaranteeing a subsidiary's bond payments.
- Charging higher commissions due to a trade’s risk or liquidity, provided the client is informed and agrees.

### Prohibited Statements
- Using terms like "approved" or "endorsed" when referring to registration status.
- Guaranteeing investment performance or gains.

### Case Scenarios on Jurisdiction
1. **Offer by an agent in State X to a client in State Y (no purchase made):** Jurisdiction is with both State X (origin) and State Y (directed into).
2. **TV ad broadcast in State D, received in States D, E, and F:** Jurisdiction is only in State D.
3. **Advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation based in State H, read in State G:** No jurisdiction anywhere as it’s not considered an offer.

An advertisement in a newspaper is only considered an offer in the state where the paper is published. However, if more than two-thirds of the paper’s circulation is outside the state of publication, the advertisement is not considered an offer in any state. Since the Hometown Gazette is a local paper, assume that its distribution is primarily in the state of publication.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and its rules, including the “Marketing Rule,” technically apply only to federal covered (SEC-registered) advisers. State-registered advisers are subject to the marketing rules of the Uniform Securities Act (as adopted by their state). However, some states have adopted the updated SEC marketing rule by incorporating it into, or referencing it in, their state securities law.

An email blast is an offer only in the state of origination. However, an exception applies to electronic communications that are not transmitted within the state of creation (Florida in this case). In this case, the blast is an offer in any state into which it is transmitted.

Splitting commissions with a State B-licensed agent does not satisfy the 30/60-day agent exclusions for vacationing/new resident clients. The agent can do business with this client for up to 30 days without registering in State B. If the client remains in State B for longer than 30 days, the agent must register there. If the agent begins the registration process, they may continue to service the client for the duration of their stay. Another option would be for the BD to reassing the account to a State B registered agent.

A customer’s return in a margin account will be two times the return on the stock due to margin account leveraging.

Adoption occurs when an adviser explicitly or implicitly endorses or approves of certain (promotional) information after it is published.

In the context of the **Series 63** exam, the terms **entanglement**, **adoption**, **coordination**, and **qualification** relate to specific legal and regulatory concepts in securities laws:

1. **Entanglement**: This refers to a situation where a firm or individual becomes involved with third-party content (e.g., on social media) to such an extent that they take on responsibility for that content. If a firm contributes to, edits, or endorses third-party content, they may be considered "entangled" and thus responsible for its accuracy under securities laws.

2. **Adoption**: Similar to entanglement, adoption occurs when a firm or individual endorses or uses third-party information as their own. By "adopting" content, the firm assumes responsibility for its compliance with regulations, such as ensuring the content is not misleading.

3. **Coordination**: Refers to a method of **registering securities** at both the federal and state levels simultaneously. If a security is registered with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the issuer can "coordinate" that registration with state authorities, streamlining the process.

4. **Qualification**: This is a method of registering securities at the **state level** when no federal registration is required. The issuer must meet all state-specific requirements, which are generally more detailed and stringent than the coordination process.

These terms reflect key regulatory procedures and responsibilities in securities offerings, disclosures, and communication under state laws relevant to the Series 63 exam.

Advisers must perform due diligence to ensure any third-party rating is not skewed and clearly and prominently disclose the date of the rating and the time period covered, the identity of the third party that created the rating, and whether any direct or indirect compensation was paid for obtaining or using the rating. It is not required to be further fact checked.

The **ADV form** is a key document used by investment advisers to register with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or state securities authorities. It provides crucial information about the adviser's business, including its services, fees, and any disciplinary history. The form consists of several parts, each serving a specific purpose:

### Parts of the ADV Form:

1. **Part 1**: 
   - **Focus**: Provides general information about the investment advisory firm, its operations, and disciplinary history.
   - **Contents**:
     - Basic details like the firm’s name, location, and regulatory status.
     - Information on how the firm is structured, including ownership.
     - Disciplinary history of the firm and its management personnel.
     - The types of clients served (e.g., individuals, businesses).
     - Business practices, including custody of client funds, types of advisory services offered, and methods of compensation (e.g., fees, commissions).

2. **Part 2A (Firm Brochure)**: 
   - **Focus**: This is a narrative brochure that describes the firm’s services and business practices in a format that is more accessible to clients and prospective clients.
   - **Contents**:
     - Types of advisory services offered (e.g., portfolio management, financial planning).
     - Fee structures and how clients are billed.
     - Methods of analysis, investment strategies, and risk factors.
     - Disclosures about potential conflicts of interest.
     - Information about the firm’s disciplinary history, if applicable.
     - Other relevant business activities of the adviser.

   - **Contents**:
     - Educational background and business experience of the supervised persons.
     - Disciplinary actions, if any, involving these individuals.
     - Potential conflicts of interest related to the supervised persons.
     - Other business activities these individuals may be involved in outside their role as investment advisers.

4. **Part 3 (Form CRS - Client Relationship Summary)**:
   - **Focus**: A concise, easy-to-read summary that helps retail investors understand the nature of their relationship with the firm.
   - **Contents**:
     - Key information about the services provided.
     - Fees, costs, conflicts of interest, and the firm's legal obligations.
     - Comparison of advisory and brokerage services (if applicable).
     - Where clients can get more detailed information or file complaints.

### Key Purposes of the ADV Form:
- **Transparency**: Provides detailed information about the investment adviser's business and practices, allowing clients and regulators to assess suitability and regulatory compliance.
- **Registration**: Required for registering the adviser with either the SEC (for firms managing over $100 million in assets) or state regulators (for smaller firms).
- **Disclosure**: Ensures that potential conflicts of interest and other critical information are disclosed to clients.

Investment advisers must update their ADV forms annually, or more frequently if there are material changes, ensuring that clients and regulators always have access to the most current information.

he Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires investment advisers to give each advisory client several disclosure documents. Form ADV, Part 2A is the brochure and discloses information about the IA firm. Part 2B, known as the brochure supplement, discloses information about the specific IAR who will offer advice and make discretionary decisions for the client. Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) further requires delivery of Part 3, which is the client relationship summary.

NASAA rules require a brochure to delivered to a new client at least 48 hours prior to entering into an advisory contract with the client. Alternatively, the advisor may deliver the brochure at the time the contract is executed, provided the client has the right to cancel the contract w/o penalty during the first five business days after executing the contract. This means that the client may recover any "setup" fees that were paid to the advisor, but not fees for any advisory services that were paid during those first five business days.
