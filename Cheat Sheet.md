An advertisement in a newspaper is only considered an offer in the state where the paper is published. However, if more than two-thirds of the paper’s circulation is outside the state of publication, the advertisement is not considered an offer in any state. Since the Hometown Gazette is a local paper, assume that its distribution is primarily in the state of publication.

Form ADV made simple
Form ADV is used by IA to register with the state.

Part 1 provides information about the firm such type of business (LLC, Sole proprietorship ect), location blah blah

Part 2 is THE brochure. It basically answers any question a client may have (fees, how it is calculated, discretionary authority, term of contract).

That's how I make sense of it.

Consent to service of process is a legal agreement in which an individual or entity agrees to accept legal papers in a jurisdiction where they may not physically reside or have a place of business.
