Here's a comprehensive study guide for the passage on agents in the securities industry, formatted in markdown:

# Agents in the Securities Industry

## 1. Definition of an Agent

- An **individual** (human being, not a firm or entity)
- Represents broker-dealers
- Affects securities transactions
- Typically employees of broker-dealers

## 2. Agent Registration Requirements

### 2.1 Registration Triggers

Agents must register in any state where they "do business":

1. **Originate** an offer in the state
2. **Direct** an offer into the state
3. **Receive and accept** an offer from the state

### 2.2 Key Differences from Broker-Dealer Registration

- Based on **offers**, not physical presence or client residency
- Applies to both retail and institutional clients

## 3. Exemptions from Agent Registration

### 3.1 Administrative and Clerical Staff

- Do not affect securities transactions
- **Note**: Actual duties may override job title

### 3.2 Employee of Issuer Exemption

Applies to employees representing issuers in:

- Transactions in exempt securities
- Exempt transactions
- Sales of securities to existing employees without commissions

**Important**: Only applies when working for the issuing company, not for a broker-dealer

## 4. Agent Registration Process

### 4.1 Form U4

- Biographical information
- Work history
- Criminal record (if any)

### 4.2 Additional Requirements

- Agent in New York office
- Calls institutional client in New Jersey
- Purchase made
- **Registration required**: New York and New Jersey

### 5.3 Key Takeaway

- Agent registration based on offer origination and direction, not client type

## 6. Consent to Service of Process

### 6.1 Valid for

- Civil actions for USA (Uniform Securities Act) violations

### 6.2 Not Valid for

- Non-securities related civil actions (e.g., slip and fall)
- Criminal actions (USA violations or other crimes)

### 6.3 Requirements

- Each state where agent is registered requires separate consent
- Consent does not need to be renewed
- Remains in effect indefinitely

## 7. Key Points to Remember

- Agents are individuals, not firms
- Registration based on "doing business" through offers
- Employee of Issuer Exemption only applies when working for the issuing company
- Form U4 for registration, Form U5 for termination
- Consent to service of process is crucial but limited to securities-related civil actions

Not held order
When a customer verbally specifies the action (buy or sell), the amount (number of shares or dollar amount) or asset (the underlying security) is referred to as a not held order. A not held order is not true discretion because it gives the agent the ability to pick the right time and price. This order is only good for the day it was requested.

Registration forms are completed electronically through the central registration depository (CRD) system, which offers shared access to industry regulators.

An individual may be registered with two different BDs simultaneously, provided the two firms are under the same common control, or are owned by the same parent company.


Individuals employed by a broker-dealer who are effecting transactions in securities, are considered AGENTS of the broker-dealer and must satisfy applicable registration standards, as mandated by the state. It is not relevant whether the securities are exempt or not.


The Uniform Securities Act defines a broker-dealer as a person that who has an office in this state OR has at least one retail client in this state. The USA excludes the following from the definition:
• Issuers of securities
• Banks
• Savings institutions
• Trust companies
• Credit unions

A partner, officer of director of a broker-dealer is required to register as an agent only if he/she conducts agent activities—i.e., if involved in effecting or attempting to effect securities transactions.

Were you looking at the CTO who directly oversees registered agents? Supervision triggers registration as an IAR if supervising other IARs (but this rule does not apply to those supervising agents).

In the context of the **Series 63** exam, the terms **entanglement**, **adoption**, **coordination**, and **qualification** relate to specific legal and regulatory concepts in securities laws:

1. **Entanglement**: This refers to a situation where a firm or individual becomes involved with third-party content (e.g., on social media) to such an extent that they take on responsibility for that content. If a firm contributes to, edits, or endorses third-party content, they may be considered "entangled" and thus responsible for its accuracy under securities laws.

2. **Adoption**: Similar to entanglement, adoption occurs when a firm or individual endorses or uses third-party information as their own. By "adopting" content, the firm assumes responsibility for its compliance with regulations, such as ensuring the content is not misleading.

3. **Coordination**: Refers to a method of **registering securities** at both the federal and state levels simultaneously. If a security is registered with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the issuer can "coordinate" that registration with state authorities, streamlining the process.

4. **Qualification**: This is a method of registering securities at the **state level** when no federal registration is required. The issuer must meet all state-specific requirements, which are generally more detailed and stringent than the coordination process.

These terms reflect key regulatory procedures and responsibilities in securities offerings, disclosures, and communication under state laws relevant to the Series 63 exam.
There are two types of agents under the USA: those who represent BDs and those who represent issuers. There are many more exclusions to the definition of issuer agent than there are to the definition of BD agent. Individuals who represent an issuer selling certain exempt securities, such as commercial paper directly to investors, are not defined as issuer agents. Nor are issuer employees who are paid a salary to sell company stock to other employees. On the other hand, BD employees who are engaged in any kind of securities transactions, even if they only trade U.S. government securities, are defined as agents. However, BD employees who are not engaged in securities transactions, such as accountants, are not classified as agents.


Securities offered by a broker-dealer located in a bank branch can occur, however the following need to be put in place: The products are subject to loss. The securities are not guaranteed or backed by the bank. The securities are NOT covered by FDIC. Securities business has to be in a separate location with a SIPC logo.

This financial institution is a commercial bank, not a BD. It is not engaged in the sale of any securities products, based on the information provided in the question. Therefore, it is not considered a BD in the state and is thus not required to register as a BD in any state in which it is operating.

Surety Bonding in Series 63:
Who Needs Surety Bonds?:
Broker-dealers and investment advisers may be required by state regulators to post surety bonds if they:
Have custody of client funds or securities.
Have discretionary authority over client accounts.
The bond acts as a financial guarantee to cover potential losses incurred by clients due to misconduct by the securities professional.

In the context of the Series 63 exam, surety bonding refers to a requirement that certain securities professionals—such as broker-dealers or investment advisers—must obtain to ensure they can meet financial obligations related to their business practices. It serves as a form of protection for clients in case the securities professional engages in unethical practices, such as fraud or misappropriation of client funds.

 **Fidelity Bond vs. Surety Bond**:
   - While **surety bonds** ensure that a firm can meet certain obligations (such as paying claims or adhering to regulatory standards), **fidelity bonds** specifically protect against internal misconduct, ensuring that clients or the firm can recover losses caused by employee dishonesty.


### Fidelity Bonds in Relation to the Series 63:

1. **Who Requires Fidelity Bonds?**
   - **Broker-dealers** and **investment advisers** with custody of client funds or securities are often required by state regulators or self-regulatory organizations (like FINRA) to maintain fidelity bond coverage.
   - The bond serves as protection against losses resulting from employee malfeasance that could negatively affect clients.

2. **What Do Fidelity Bonds Cover?**
   - Fidelity bonds typically cover dishonest acts by employees, such as:
     - **Theft** of client assets.
     - **Embezzlement** or misappropriation of client funds.
     - **Forgery** or fraud committed by the firm's personnel.
   - These bonds do not cover poor investment decisions or market losses, as they are meant specifically to protect against misconduct.

   3. **Regulatory Requirements**:
   - Some **states** and regulatory bodies, like **FINRA**, have specific minimum coverage amounts for fidelity bonds. For example:
     - **FINRA** requires that broker-dealers carry a fidelity bond to protect against losses from employee dishonesty, with minimum coverage based on the firm's size and the amount of client assets held.
   - **State securities regulators** may impose similar requirements for registered investment advisers under their jurisdiction.

- **Registration Requirements**:
  - Dealers (BDs) must register with the state(s) where they have a place of business or conduct business with one or more retail clients.
  - BDs must identify all their branch offices to the state(s).

- **Notice Filing**:
  - Notice filing is an abbreviated notification that does not require administrator approval and cannot be denied.
  - BDs' registration, however, can be denied.

- **Additional Requirements**:
  - Notice filing requires filing fees.
  - Notice filing must be renewed by December 31 each year.


Since the banker is securities licensed, the employee must be registered with FINRA and most likely a state. The banker is also a RR, since he is licensed as a representative for the firm’s broker-dealer.

If a state Administrator believes that a firm is improperly supervising agents, the state can proceed with charges against the BD and the agent. Note that a "failure to supervise" violation against a firm only happens in situations where the agent has done something improper as well. Therefore, the firm can be charged for improper supervision, while the agent would be charged for whatever violation they performed (that would have led to the failure to supervise).
