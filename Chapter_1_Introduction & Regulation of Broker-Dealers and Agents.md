Here's a comprehensive study guide for the passage on agents in the securities industry, formatted in markdown:

# Agents in the Securities Industry

## 1. Definition of an Agent

- An **individual** (human being, not a firm or entity)
- Represents broker-dealers
- Affects securities transactions
- Typically employees of broker-dealers

## 2. Agent Registration Requirements

### 2.1 Registration Triggers

Agents must register in any state where they "do business":

1. **Originate** an offer in the state
2. **Direct** an offer into the state
3. **Receive and accept** an offer from the state

### 2.2 Key Differences from Broker-Dealer Registration

- Based on **offers**, not physical presence or client residency
- Applies to both retail and institutional clients

## 3. Exemptions from Agent Registration

### 3.1 Administrative and Clerical Staff

- Do not affect securities transactions
- **Note**: Actual duties may override job title

### 3.2 Employee of Issuer Exemption

Applies to employees representing issuers in:

- Transactions in exempt securities
- Exempt transactions
- Sales of securities to existing employees without commissions

**Important**: Only applies when working for the issuing company, not for a broker-dealer

## 4. Agent Registration Process

### 4.1 Form U4

- Biographical information
- Work history
- Criminal record (if any)

### 4.2 Additional Requirements

- Consent to service of process
- Filing fees
- Bonding (insurance)

### 4.3 No Financial Thresholds

- Unlike broker-dealers, agents don't need to meet net worth requirements

### 4.4 Registration Effective Date

- **Noon, 30 days after filing**
- Unless the administrator acts affirmatively

### 4.5 Renewal

- Required every **December 31st**

### 4.6 Termination

- File **Form U5**
- **All parties** must notify the state securities administrator
  - Agent
  - Old firm
  - New firm

## 5. Practice Scenarios

### 5.1 Scenario 1

- Agent in New York office
- Calls retail client in New Jersey
- No purchase made
- **Registration required**: New York and New Jersey

### 5.2 Scenario 2

- Agent in New York office
- Calls institutional client in New Jersey
- Purchase made
- **Registration required**: New York and New Jersey

### 5.3 Key Takeaway

- Agent registration based on offer origination and direction, not client type

## 6. Consent to Service of Process

### 6.1 Valid for

- Civil actions for USA (Uniform Securities Act) violations

### 6.2 Not Valid for

- Non-securities related civil actions (e.g., slip and fall)
- Criminal actions (USA violations or other crimes)

### 6.3 Requirements

- Each state where agent is registered requires separate consent
- Consent does not need to be renewed
- Remains in effect indefinitely

## 7. Key Points to Remember

- Agents are individuals, not firms
- Registration based on "doing business" through offers
- Employee of Issuer Exemption only applies when working for the issuing company
- Form U4 for registration, Form U5 for termination
- Consent to service of process is crucial but limited to securities-related civil actions

Not held order
When a customer verbally specifies the action (buy or sell), the amount (number of shares or dollar amount) or asset (the underlying security) is referred to as a not held order. A not held order is not true discretion because it gives the agent the ability to pick the right time and price. This order is only good for the day it was requested.

Registration forms are completed electronically through the central registration depository (CRD) system, which offers shared access to industry regulators.

An individual may be registered with two different BDs simultaneously, provided the two firms are under the same common control, or are owned by the same parent company.


Individuals employed by a broker-dealer who are effecting transactions in securities, are considered AGENTS of the broker-dealer and must satisfy applicable registration standards, as mandated by the state. It is not relevant whether the securities are exempt or not.


The Uniform Securities Act defines a broker-dealer as a person that who has an office in this state OR has at least one retail client in this state. The USA excludes the following from the definition:
• Issuers of securities
• Banks
• Savings institutions
• Trust companies
• Credit unions

A partner, officer of director of a broker-dealer is required to register as an agent only if he/she conducts agent activities—i.e., if involved in effecting or attempting to effect securities transactions.

Were you looking at the CTO who directly oversees registered agents? Supervision triggers registration as an IAR if supervising other IARs (but this rule does not apply to those supervising agents).

In the context of the **Series 63** exam, the terms **entanglement**, **adoption**, **coordination**, and **qualification** relate to specific legal and regulatory concepts in securities laws:

1. **Entanglement**: This refers to a situation where a firm or individual becomes involved with third-party content (e.g., on social media) to such an extent that they take on responsibility for that content. If a firm contributes to, edits, or endorses third-party content, they may be considered "entangled" and thus responsible for its accuracy under securities laws.

2. **Adoption**: Similar to entanglement, adoption occurs when a firm or individual endorses or uses third-party information as their own. By "adopting" content, the firm assumes responsibility for its compliance with regulations, such as ensuring the content is not misleading.

3. **Coordination**: Refers to a method of **registering securities** at both the federal and state levels simultaneously. If a security is registered with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the issuer can "coordinate" that registration with state authorities, streamlining the process.

4. **Qualification**: This is a method of registering securities at the **state level** when no federal registration is required. The issuer must meet all state-specific requirements, which are generally more detailed and stringent than the coordination process.

These terms reflect key regulatory procedures and responsibilities in securities offerings, disclosures, and communication under state laws relevant to the Series 63 exam.
