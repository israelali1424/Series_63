# Chapter Four: Remedies and Administrative Provisions

This chapter outlines the roles, powers, and actions available to state securities administrators under the Uniform Securities Act (USA).

## Key Goals and Takeaways

### 1. Jurisdiction
Understanding when and where state securities administrators have the authority to take action. Jurisdiction is triggered when:
- An offer originates in the state.
- An offer is directed into the state.
- An offer is accepted in the state.

### 2. Distinguishing Administrative Actions
- **Revocation**: Permanent removal of registration due to violations.
- **Suspension**: Temporary removal of registration, often as a disciplinary measure.
- **Cancellation**: Occurs when a registration is no longer applicable due to reasons like death, dissolution, or legal incompetence.
- **Withdrawal**: Voluntary termination by the registered individual or firm, which becomes effective after 30 days but remains under the administrator's jurisdiction for one year.

### 3. Penalties for Violations
If violations of the Uniform Securities Act occur, administrators can impose various penalties, including fines, suspensions, revocations, or other sanctions, depending on the nature and severity of the violation.

### 4. Powers of the State Securities Administrator
- **Rulemaking**: Can create rules (applying broadly) or orders (specific to individuals or instances).
- **Investigations and Subpoenas**: Can conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, and enforce compliance within or beyond state borders.
- **Cease and Desist Orders**: Issued when there is suspicion of wrongdoing, requiring a halt in actions while further investigations occur.
- **Deny, Suspend, Cancel, or Revoke Registrations**: Can take these actions against individuals or firms if in the public's best interest and if violations have occurred.

### 5. Handling Criminal Records
- Securities-related misdemeanors and felonies within the past 10 years lead to statutory disqualification.
- Non-securities related misdemeanors generally do not disqualify unless they undermine the credibility or trustworthiness required in securities roles.

### 6. Examples and Case Analysis
- Illustrations of jurisdiction include multiple states having authority over a transaction based on where the offer originated, where it was directed, and where it was accepted.
- Specific administrative actions like suspending a broker-dealer for violations or canceling a registration due to non-response or legal incompetence are critical in maintaining regulatory standards.

These key points form the foundation for understanding the authority and tools available to state securities administrators, and how they maintain the integrity of securities markets by protecting investors and enforcing regulations.

State Administrators generally do not have jurisdiction over the registration of agents or branches of SEC-registered firms. However, they do have jurisdiction over offers and transactions that originate in the state, are directed into the state, or are completed in the state.

## Violations of the Uniform Securities Act: Civil and Criminal Liabilities

### 1. Civil vs. Criminal Liabilities

- **Civil Liabilities**:  
  - Involves lawsuits where the investor (victim) sues the securities professional (perpetrator). 
  - The goal is to make the victim whole, which includes:
    - Recovering the amount lost due to the violation.
    - Interest accrued from the payment date.
    - Legal costs (attorneyâ€™s fees).
    - Subtracting any income received from the investment (e.g., dividends or capital gains).
  - **Statute of Limitations for Civil Cases**:  
    - The lawsuit must be filed within the earlier of:
      - Three years from the violation date.
      - Two years from the discovery of the violation.

- **Criminal Liabilities**:  
  - The government prosecutes the agent or investment advisor representative for the violation, not the state securities administrator or harmed investors.
  - Penalties include:
    - Fines up to $5,000.
    - Up to three years in state jail (decided by the judge based on the severity of the violation).
  - **Statute of Limitations for Criminal Cases**:  
    - Legal actions must be initiated within five years of the violation.

### 2. Rescission

- If a securities professional realizes they've made an unintentional violation, such as selling unregistered non-exempt securities, they can offer rescission to avoid being sued.
- Rescission involves offering to:
  - Unwind the transaction.
  - Make the investor whole.

### 3. Specific Violation Scenarios

- Selling unregistered non-exempt securities in a non-exempt transaction to a retail client is a violation.
- Certain exemptions protect the professional from violation claims:
  - Selling exempt securities.
  - Engaging in exempt transactions (e.g., with institutional clients).

### 4. Advertising and Sales Literature

- State securities administrators can require the filing of advertising and sales literature related to securities distribution.
- Exceptions:
  - If the securities or transactions are exempt (including federal covered securities).

### 5. Practical Exam Questions

- The exam may include questions that test your understanding of:
  - Civil vs. criminal cases.
  - Determining statute limitations.
  - Recognizing the proper filing requirements for advertising related to securities.

These concepts are essential for understanding the legal framework governing securities professionals and the protections in place for investors.

Administrators have jurisdictions over offers or transactions that: 1) originate in the state, 2) are directed into the state, or 3) are settled or completed in the state.



A disclosure brochure is not required to be delivered if the client is a registered investment company or if the advisory service is of an impersonal nature and costs less than $500. A disclosure brochure is not required when a customer opens a brokerage account. A brochure is required when the service provided is an individual supervisory service. Note: A client's net worth has no bearing on brochure delivery requirements.


Prior to completing a new account form and customer profile, only unsolicited orders may be accepted. The rationale is that these orders do not involve a recommendation. The profile is required to assure that recommendations match customer needs and objectives. While IA client relationships are generally guided by the advisory agreement and not a "new account form/client profile," this would be true of an IA that is a dual capacity firm (acting as a BD in addition to its IA role).

A state Administrator has jurisdiction over any securities offers and sales that:

I) Originated in the state
II) Directed into the state
III) Are completed in the state


Under the USA, the maximum penalties for fraud are a $5,000 fine and/or three years imprisonment

A final determination by the state Administrator, made pursuant to a hearing requested by the registrant, becomes effective immediately (December 3 in this case), provided the Administrator takes summary action. In this case, the license is reinstated if the registrant is successful in appealing to the court.

Notification of registration withdrawal requirements depend on whether the RIA is federal- or state-registered. If federal: The IAR is ultimately responsible for notifying the Administrator. If state: The RIA must notify the Administrator.

All broker-dealers must maintain an SEC-prescribed minimum amount of net capital, the purpose of which is the maintain enough liquidity to protect customers. States often impose similar minimums.

Regardless of the amount, cash or non-cash compensation paid to third parties for testimonials or endorsements must be disclosed in IA advertising. A written agreement with the party is required if the compensation exceeds $1,000. Testimonials or endorsements made by affiliates of the firms are not subject to these disclosure requirements.
