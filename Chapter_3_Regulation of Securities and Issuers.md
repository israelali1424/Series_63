# Exempt Securities and Transactions under the Uniform Securities Act

## Overview
- **Exempt Securities**: Certain securities that do not require registration under the Uniform Securities Act.
- **Exempt Transactions**: Certain types of transactions that do not require the involved securities to be registered.

## Exempt Securities
Exempt securities are specified under the Uniform Securities Act, which often overlaps with federal exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933, but state law exemptions are broader. Here are key categories:

### Key Exempt Securities
1. **US Government Securities**: Treasuries and other federal obligations.
2. **Foreign Government Securities**: National securities from foreign countries (e.g., bonds from France or Germany). 
   - **Non-Exempt**: Foreign municipal securities (e.g., Paris or Berlin municipal bonds).
3. **US and Canadian Municipal Securities**: 
   - All US municipal securities are exempt.
   - Canadian municipal securities also receive special exempt treatment.
4. **Bank and Credit Union Securities**: Securities issued by banks, savings institutions, and credit unions.
5. **Insurance Companies**: Securities from companies authorized to sell insurance in the state.
6. **Public Utility Securities**: Securities issued by public utilities.
7. **Commercial Paper**: Short-term corporate debt instruments.
8. **Employee Benefit Plan Securities**: Securities related to employee stock purchase, pension, or profit-sharing plans.
9. **Non-Profit Organization Securities**: Securities from non-profits like churches or educational institutions.
10. **Federally Covered Securities**: Securities regulated by the federal government (e.g., securities listed on national exchanges, investment companies).
   - **Examples**: Mutual funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, and UITs.

### Revocable Exemptions
- **Employee Benefit Plans and Non-Profit Securities**: Exemptions can be revoked by the state administrator if fraud or suspicious activities are suspected.

## Exempt Transactions
Transactions can be exempt if the method of sale reduces regulatory concerns.

### Key Exempt Transactions
1. **Isolated Non-Issuer Transactions**: 
   - Infrequent sales by parties other than the issuer.
   - Lower fraud risk as the company does not receive proceeds.
2. **Unsolicited Transactions**:
   - Client-initiated trades where the security is not registered in the state.
3. **Underwriter Transactions**:
   - Transactions involving underwriting activities.
4. **Fiduciary Transactions**:
   - Transactions by court-appointed fiduciaries (e.g., trustees, executors).
   - **Non-Exempt**: Custodians who are self-appointed.
5. **Institutional Transactions**:
   - Transactions involving large, sophisticated parties.
6. **Limited Offering Transactions (State Private Placements)**:
   - Similar to Regulation D at the federal level, with specific state rules and investor counts.
7. **Transactions with Existing Securities Holders**:
   - Offerings like rights or follow-on offerings to current shareholders.

### Revocable Transactions
- **Exempt Transactions** can be revoked by the administrator if fraud or suspicious activity is suspected.

## Important Concepts and Requirements
1. **Notice Filing**: Federally covered securities must provide notice filings in states where they are offered.
2. **Non-Security Transactions**: Items like real estate, gold, and fixed insurance products are not considered securities and do not require registration.
3. **Security vs. Transaction Exemptions**: A security may be exempt, a transaction may be exempt, or both. This affects whether registration is required.
4. **Registration Requirements for Persons**:
   - Exemptions do not affect the need for broker-dealers, agents, investment advisers, or their representatives to be registered.

## Flowchart for Determining Registration Requirements
1. **Is the Sale Involving a Security?**
   - If not, no registration needed.
2. **Is the Security Exempt?**
   - If yes, no registration required; check for notice filing requirements if federally covered.
3. **Is the Transaction Exempt?**
   - If yes, no registration required for the transaction.
4. **Non-Exempt Security or Transaction**:
   - Registration required at the state level.
   - Use qualification for single-state offerings or coordination for multi-state offerings.

## Example Questions and Analysis
### Sample True/False Statements
1. **Parker offering Gamma shares in State A and B**: False. Shares are not registered in State B.
2. **Parker offering Gamma shares in State A and C**: False. Parker is not registered in State C.
3. **Parker accepting unsolicited orders from State B**: True. Unsolicited orders are exempt transactions.
4. **Parker accepting unsolicited orders from State C**: False. Parker is not registered in State C.

### Key Points to Remember
- **Person Registration**: Registration of securities does not negate the need for individuals (agents, advisers) to also be registered.
- **Exempt Security or Transaction**: Determines whether the security must be registered, not whether the individual can engage in the transaction without registration.

## Summary
- **Exemptions** allow certain securities and transactions to bypass registration due to reduced fraud risk or federal coverage.
- **Registration**: Required when exemptions do not apply, using qualification or coordination methods depending on the scope of distribution.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: State administrators retain rights to revoke exemptions or require registration when necessary to protect investors.

Use this guide to review the key 
Municipal securities are federal covered securities outside the state of issuance, but within the state of issuance the state admin will have jurisdiction. Note that investment company securities, such as mutual funds, are federally covered.


Registration is not required in the state if the private placement securities are offered to no more than 10 non-institutional investors in a 12-month period. There is no limit on the number of institutional investors that can purchase, and therefore the offering can be made to an unlimited number of persons (since the term persons includes institutional investors). All the other choices are example of exempt transactions.


Any security issued by the federal government of a country with which the U.S. maintains diplomatic relations is exempt from state (USA) registration requirements.

States can’t require the filing of periodic reports more often than quarterly. Quarterly reports (10-Qs) are the SEC standard for an issuer’s filing of periodic reports federal covered securities.

An email blast is an offer only in the state of origination, which in this case is State Q.


ssues of companies listed on a major exchange are considered federally covered and are not required to register in the state. Government securities, municipal securities, and Canadian municipal securities are not required to register. There is no exemption for over-the-counter (e.g., OTC Pink) securities.

The definition of securities has three parts:
1. **Evidence of ownership**,
2. **Can be traded for value**, and
3. **Is managed through the efforts of a third party**.


For registration by Qualification, the state Administrator will decide a securities effective date.

Registration by Coordination is effective once the SEC says it’s effective. The issuer must file with the state at least 10 days prior to becoming effective with the SEC.

A security would be federally covered if it trades on a national exchange. Pink Sheet stocks are traded over the counter and are not on a major exchange.

To register by coordination, the issuer is registering with the SEC and the state at the same time. Registering with the SEC requires a registration statement to be filed.


Consent to Service of Process is a legal document that a broker-dealer, investment adviser, or their representatives must file with state securities regulators as part of their registration process. By signing this document, the registrant agrees to allow the state regulator to receive legal papers (such as lawsuits) on their behalf, should they become involved in a legal dispute related to their securities business.

**Consent to Service of Process** is a legal document that a broker-dealer, investment adviser, or their representatives must file with state securities regulators as part of their registration process. By signing this document, the registrant agrees to allow the state regulator to receive legal papers (such as lawsuits) on their behalf, should they become involved in a legal dispute related to their securities business.

### Key Points:
- **Purpose**: Ensures that legal actions can be taken against the registrant within the state without needing to serve them directly.
- **Requirement**: Typically filed during the registration process with state securities regulators.
- **Applicability**: Common for broker-dealers, investment advisers, and their agents when registering in a state.


Securities are subject to the registration requirements of the **Uniform Securities Act (USA)** unless they are:
1. **Exempt from registration** under the USA, or
2. **Federal covered securities** precluded from state registration by **NSMIA** (National Securities Markets Improvement Act).

- **U.S. Treasury bonds** are both exempt and federal covered.
- **NASDAQ-listed stocks** are federal covered.
- **Bank securities** are exempt under the USA.
- **Bank stocks** are exempt, however, **bank holding company stocks** are not exempt.



### Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Transactions (Series 63)

#### Exempt Transactions:
- **Definition**: Transactions that are not required to register with the state under the Uniform Securities Act.
- **Common Examples**:
  - **Isolated non-issuer transactions**: One-time trades that don’t involve an issuer (e.g., private resale).
  - **Unsolicited brokerage transactions**: Transactions initiated by the client, not the broker.
  - **Institutional investor transactions**: Trades with financial institutions like banks or insurance companies.
  - **Fiduciary transactions**: Executed by executors, trustees, or guardians.
  - **Private placements**: Offers made to a limited number of investors (typically fewer than 10 within 12 months).
- **Purpose**: Reduces the regulatory burden for certain investors and transactions where full state oversight is unnecessary.

#### Non-Exempt Transactions:
- **Definition**: Transactions that must be registered with the state.
- **Examples**:
  - **Public offerings**: Offers made to the general public.
  - **Issuer transactions**: When the issuer itself is involved in the sale of securities.
  - **Solicited transactions**: Transactions initiated by brokers or agents rather than the client.

#### Key Points for Series 63:
- Exempt transactions often involve private, unsolicited, or institutional trades.
- Non-exempt transactions typically require full registration and are more public-facing.


### Fiduciary Transactions Exempt from State Registration (Series 63)

Fiduciary transactions are exempt from state registration under the **Uniform Securities Act (USA)** in certain situations where individuals act in a fiduciary capacity. Here’s a summary of common exempt fiduciary transactions:

#### **Exempt Fiduciary Transactions**:
1. **Executors of Estates**: 
   - Transactions conducted by an executor, administrator, or personal representative of an estate are exempt. These individuals manage the assets of a deceased person.

2. **Trustees in Bankruptcy**: 
   - Transactions conducted by a trustee appointed during a bankruptcy process are exempt, as they act to settle the bankrupt entity’s debts.

3. **Guardians or Conservators**: 
   - Transactions by a guardian or conservator on behalf of a minor or incapacitated person are exempt. These individuals manage the assets of the person under their care.

4. **Receivers**: 
   - Transactions made by a court-appointed receiver (e.g., in the case of a company liquidation) are also exempt.

#### Key Points:
- **Nature of Role**: The exemption applies because these individuals are acting in a fiduciary capacity, managing another party's assets rather than for their own benefit.
- **State Law**: Even though these transactions are exempt from state registration, other securities laws (federal or otherwise) may still apply.

**Administrator**
Following the issuance of a stop order by an Administrator, the Administrator must offer a hearing to address deficiencies or violations. If the issuer doesn’t accept the offer of a hearing within 15 days, the order becomes effective.

Testimonials must disclose whether or not cash or non-cash compensation was provided for the testimonial. Any material conflicts of interest must be disclosed. But if there are none, the disclosure is not required.


### Exempt Securities on the Series 63

On the Series 63 exam, **exempt securities** refer to those securities that are exempt from registration requirements under state securities laws, as outlined in the Uniform Securities Act. These securities can be sold without the need for state registration, although they may still be subject to anti-fraud provisions.

#### Common Exempt Securities:
1. **U.S. Government Securities**: Treasury bonds, bills, and notes.
2. **Municipal Securities**: Bonds issued by states, cities, and other local government entities.
3. **Securities of Banks and Savings Institutions**: Stocks or bonds issued by banks or savings and loan institutions.
4. **Commercial Paper**: Short-term debt securities with a maturity of 270 days or less.
5. **Non-Profit Securities**: Securities issued by non-profit organizations, such as religious or charitable organizations.
6. **Public Utility Securities**: Securities issued by regulated public utilities.
7. **Insurance Company Securities**: Securities issued by insurance companies (not variable contracts).

These securities are generally considered lower risk and thus are exempt from the more stringent state registration processes.
