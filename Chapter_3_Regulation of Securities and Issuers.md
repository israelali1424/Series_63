Here's a comprehensive study guide summarizing the key points from the passage:

# Securities Regulation and Registration Study Guide

- Balance study time accordingly

## II. Chapter Goals
1. Differentiate between securities and non-securities under the Uniform Securities Act
2. Understand state-level securities registration process
3. Learn about exempt securities
4. Learn about exempt transactions

## III. Definition of a Security (Supreme Court's Howey Test)
A security is an investment that meets all four criteria:
1. Investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With expectation of profits
4. Derived from efforts of others

## IV. Examples of Securities and Non-Securities

### Securities:

## V. Securities Registration at State Level

### General Principle:
Securities must be registered for lawful sale unless:
1. The security is exempt, or
2. The transaction is exempt

### Registration Methods:
1. **Registration by Coordination**
   - Used when registering with SEC and multiple states
   - State registration coordinated with SEC registration
   - Efficient for multi-state offerings

2. **Registration by Qualification**
   - Used for intrastate offerings (within one state)
   - Individual state qualification process

3. **Notice Filing**
   - Not a registration, but notification to states
   - Used for federal covered securities
   - Similar to federal covered advisors giving notice to states

### Important Notes:
- Securities exemptions do not affect registration requirements for persons (broker-dealers, agents, IA firms, IARs)
- Quarterly updates required for registered securities

## VI. Key Terms:
- Debenture: Unsecured bond
- Evidence of indebtedness: Similar to a bond
- Intrastate offering: Within one state
- Interstate offering: Across multiple states
- Federal covered securities: Regulated exclusively by SEC

## VII. Study Tips:
- Focus on understanding the Howey Test for defining securities
- Memorize lists of securities and non-securities
- Understand the difference between exempt securities and exempt transactions
- Know the different registration methods and when they apply
- Remember that securities exemptions don't affect person registration requirements

# Exempt Securities and Transactions under the Uniform Securities Act

## Overview
- **Exempt Securities**: Certain securities that do not require registration under the Uniform Securities Act.
- **Exempt Transactions**: Certain types of transactions that do not require the involved securities to be registered.

## Exempt Securities
Exempt securities are specified under the Uniform Securities Act, which often overlaps with federal exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933, but state law exemptions are broader. Here are key categories:

### Key Exempt Securities
1. **US Government Securities**: Treasuries and other federal obligations.
2. **Foreign Government Securities**: National securities from foreign countries (e.g., bonds from France or Germany). 
   - **Non-Exempt**: Foreign municipal securities (e.g., Paris or Berlin municipal bonds).
3. **US and Canadian Municipal Securities**: 
   - All US municipal securities are exempt.
   - Canadian municipal securities also receive special exempt treatment.
4. **Bank and Credit Union Securities**: Securities issued by banks, savings institutions, and credit unions.
5. **Insurance Companies**: Securities from companies authorized to sell insurance in the state.
6. **Public Utility Securities**: Securities issued by public utilities.
7. **Commercial Paper**: Short-term corporate debt instruments.
8. **Employee Benefit Plan Securities**: Securities related to employee stock purchase, pension, or profit-sharing plans.
9. **Non-Profit Organization Securities**: Securities from non-profits like churches or educational institutions.
10. **Federally Covered Securities**: Securities regulated by the federal government (e.g., securities listed on national exchanges, investment companies).
   - **Examples**: Mutual funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, and UITs.

### Revocable Exemptions
- **Employee Benefit Plans and Non-Profit Securities**: Exemptions can be revoked by the state administrator if fraud or suspicious activities are suspected.

## Exempt Transactions
Transactions can be exempt if the method of sale reduces regulatory concerns.

### Key Exempt Transactions
1. **Isolated Non-Issuer Transactions**: 
   - Infrequent sales by parties other than the issuer.
   - Lower fraud risk as the company does not receive proceeds.
2. **Unsolicited Transactions**:
   - Client-initiated trades where the security is not registered in the state.
3. **Underwriter Transactions**:
   - Transactions involving underwriting activities.
4. **Fiduciary Transactions**:
   - Transactions by court-appointed fiduciaries (e.g., trustees, executors).
   - **Non-Exempt**: Custodians who are self-appointed.
5. **Institutional Transactions**:
   - Transactions involving large, sophisticated parties.
6. **Limited Offering Transactions (State Private Placements)**:
   - Similar to Regulation D at the federal level, with specific state rules and investor counts.
7. **Transactions with Existing Securities Holders**:
   - Offerings like rights or follow-on offerings to current shareholders.

### Revocable Transactions
- **Exempt Transactions** can be revoked by the administrator if fraud or suspicious activity is suspected.

## Important Concepts and Requirements
1. **Notice Filing**: Federally covered securities must provide notice filings in states where they are offered.
2. **Non-Security Transactions**: Items like real estate, gold, and fixed insurance products are not considered securities and do not require registration.
3. **Security vs. Transaction Exemptions**: A security may be exempt, a transaction may be exempt, or both. This affects whether registration is required.
4. **Registration Requirements for Persons**:
   - Exemptions do not affect the need for broker-dealers, agents, investment advisers, or their representatives to be registered.

## Flowchart for Determining Registration Requirements
1. **Is the Sale Involving a Security?**
   - If not, no registration needed.
2. **Is the Security Exempt?**
   - If yes, no registration required; check for notice filing requirements if federally covered.
3. **Is the Transaction Exempt?**
   - If yes, no registration required for the transaction.
4. **Non-Exempt Security or Transaction**:
   - Registration required at the state level.
   - Use qualification for single-state offerings or coordination for multi-state offerings.

## Example Questions and Analysis
### Sample True/False Statements
1. **Parker offering Gamma shares in State A and B**: False. Shares are not registered in State B.
2. **Parker offering Gamma shares in State A and C**: False. Parker is not registered in State C.
3. **Parker accepting unsolicited orders from State B**: True. Unsolicited orders are exempt transactions.
4. **Parker accepting unsolicited orders from State C**: False. Parker is not registered in State C.

### Key Points to Remember
- **Person Registration**: Registration of securities does not negate the need for individuals (agents, advisers) to also be registered.
- **Exempt Security or Transaction**: Determines whether the security must be registered, not whether the individual can engage in the transaction without registration.

## Summary
- **Exemptions** allow certain securities and transactions to bypass registration due to reduced fraud risk or federal coverage.
- **Registration**: Required when exemptions do not apply, using qualification or coordination methods depending on the scope of distribution.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: State administrators retain rights to revoke exemptions or require registration when necessary to protect investors.

Use this guide to review the key 
Municipal securities are federal covered securities outside the state of issuance, but within the state of issuance the state admin will have jurisdiction. Note that investment company securities, such as mutual funds, are federally covered.


Registration is not required in the state if the private placement securities are offered to no more than 10 non-institutional investors in a 12-month period. There is no limit on the number of institutional investors that can purchase, and therefore the offering can be made to an unlimited number of persons (since the term persons includes institutional investors). All the other choices are example of exempt transactions.


Any security issued by the federal government of a country with which the U.S. maintains diplomatic relations is exempt from state (USA) registration requirements.

States can’t require the filing of periodic reports more often than quarterly. Quarterly reports (10-Qs) are the SEC standard for an issuer’s filing of periodic reports federal covered securities.
