# Chapter 6: Ethical Practices and Obligations

In this chapter, we delve into the conduct rules that securities professionals must follow. As expected, these are heavily tested because regulators want to ensure that you know what's allowed, what's not, what requires disclosure, and what doesn't. As you go through this material, dig deep. I must admit, I can't cover every single ethical requirement, practice obligation, model rule, or conduct rule here. You'll need to engage with practice questions to get exposure to all of these.

Historically, these questions were straightforward—like, "Can you steal from a client?" or "Can you steal from an elderly client on a fixed income?" These were obvious, but now they've been replaced with more challenging questions that require you to discern between closely related answer choices. Your study and practice in the textbook will help you align your internal compass with that of the regulators.

### Key Goals
- Differentiate between ethical and unethical business practices
- Understand relationships regarding soft dollar arrangements
- Discuss conflicts of interest
- Learn ways to safeguard client information

The questions evolve with the changing landscape of violations observed by regulators. As new violations emerge, new questions are introduced on the test, so continuous study and adjustment are crucial.

### Example Questions

1. **Excessive Trading in Client Accounts**
   - If an agent places trades excessively in a client account, it’s known as **churning**.
   - Other unethical practices include:
     - **Unsuitable Recommendations**: Recommending investments inconsistent with the client’s financial profile.
     - **Selling Away**: Engaging in securities transactions outside the broker-dealer's supervision, often without necessary approvals.
     - **Unauthorized Transactions**: Executing trades without client consent. 

2. **Fees Associated with Open-End Investment Companies**
   - For mutual funds (open-end investment companies), the potential fees are:
     - **Front-End Load**: A fee charged when buying the mutual fund.
     - **Back-End Load**: A fee charged when selling the mutual fund.
     - **12b-1 Fees**: Annual marketing or distribution fees.
   - **Commission**: Not typically associated with mutual funds; charging a commission may indicate unethical practices.

3. **No-Load Fund Fees**
   - No-load funds can have **12b-1 fees**, but they must be less than 0.25% (25 basis points). No load means no front-end or back-end load but does not mean no fees at all.

4. **Selling Dividends**
   - Persuading a client to buy a mutual fund based on an upcoming dividend is called **selling the dividend**, a prohibited practice because it misrepresents the potential returns. When the dividend is paid, the fund’s value drops by the same amount.

5. **Mutual Fund Fee Reduction Strategies**
   - Methods that can help reduce costs:
     - **Breakpoints**: Discounts based on the amount invested.
     - **Letter of Intent**: Allows the investor to receive breakpoints over time (up to 13 months).
     - **Rights of Accumulation**: Allows using share appreciation to reach breakpoints.

### Ethical Evaluation of Practices

1. **Daily Rebalancing of a Retirement Account**
   - Rebalancing daily is usually considered **churning**, leading to excessive fees or commissions, unless the account is fee-free, which is not typically assumed.

2. **High-Yield Bonds for

## Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA)

The UPIA guides fiduciaries, particularly trustees, on managing their clients' assets prudently. Key points include:

1. **Standard of Prudence**: Fiduciaries should evaluate investments within the overall portfolio context, allowing some parts to carry more risk if it aligns with the total portfolio's goals.
  
2. **Primary Consideration**: Fiduciaries must balance the trust’s risk-return objectives, even if it means pursuing higher risk strategies if the trust document supports it.

3. **Investment Flexibility**: Fiduciaries can invest in any investment type, including unregistered securities or high-risk assets, provided they align with the trust's documentation and risk-return goals.

4. **Modern Portfolio Theory and Diversification**: UPIA encourages the use of modern portfolio theory, emphasizing diversification to achieve optimal returns for a given level of risk.

5. **Delegation of Investment Functions**: Fiduciaries can delegate investment management tasks to professional advisors but retain ultimate responsibility for ensuring that those functions meet the trust's objectives.

## Soft Dollars

Soft dollars are comparable to credit card rewards or airline miles. Money managers receive rebates from broker-dealers and can use them to pay for services like research reports and analytical tools, provided these benefits are for the client's advantage. 

- **Restrictions**: Regulators restrict the use of soft dollars for unrelated expenses such as travel, office supplies, or other non-client-related items.

---

## Cybersecurity and Data Protection

Regulations emphasize safeguarding client information and identifying red flags for suspicious activities. Key points include:

- **Covered Accounts**: Focus on personal or retail accounts which require additional scrutiny.
- **Red Flags**: Suspicious activity, unusual document handling, irregular signatures, and unexpected account changes are red flags that should be reported.
- **Regulation SP**: Customers must have the option to opt out of having their non-public personal information shared.

These principles are essential for understanding how fiduciaries should manage assets under their care while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

# Custody of securities
This statement is not true regarding custody. When a firm has custody of a client's assets, it generally means they have control over the assets and can perform actions such as withdrawing money, charging for safekeeping, and removing securities. However, trading securities in the account typically requires specific authorization or discretionary power, which is different from merely having custody.

# Consent to Service of Process.
All persons who are registered with a state must also submit a consent to service of process. For any non-criminal legal matter, the state administrator can work on behalf of the person if the person has filled out the consent. Additionally, it does not have to be renewed annually.


Joint accounts must be approved in writing by both customer and firm. On the other hand, clients need not be told of commission splitting arrangements if they do not increase commissions. Nonexempt, unregistered securities sold through exempt transactions need not be registered, so there is no violation. Charging larger commissions for complex trades is permissible.


gents may borrow or lend only with clients that are financial institutions (banks, credit unions, etc.) or broker-dealers or investment advisers. They cannot lend to a customer in any other circumstance, even if that customer is a family member.
